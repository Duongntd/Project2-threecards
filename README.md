# Three Cards

## Description:
This is my first solo project using Vanilla JavaScript. The game is very simple with minimal design. Although the code i wrote is not very nice, unoptimized and there're a lot of bugs, i would still keep it as is so one day i can look back and reflect how i've changed overtime.

You can see the preview in the preview.png above.

I hosted the project via heroku. You can find it here:
